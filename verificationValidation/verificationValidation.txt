1. PSF (10 fibre exposures)

Verify using an independent set of arcs across all? lamps that the PSF 
for each of 10 traces can be correctly modeled such that the residuals are 
within TBD.

2. PSF (600 fiber exposures)

a) Verify that the PSF model based on 10 fibers  can be interpolated across arcs exposures 
for all 600 fibers, such that the residuals are within TBD.

b) Verify using odd/even fiber exposures that the interpolated PSF model can be fitted

c) [Following update of PSF model for 600 fibers] verify that a full 600 fiber exposure
can be correctly fitted.
