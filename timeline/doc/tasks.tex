\section{Tasks}

This sections lists each individual task, along with the period over which that task is expected to be implemented, and the estimated resources assigned to that task. 
Regarding the resources, the task assignees are provided, and the amount of time allocated to each assignee, in units of effective working days.

The estimated resources for Paul Price and Neven Caplar are based on following their work over the course of the past 2 years of DRP development, while for the other
resources, these are based on the capability of a typical skilled developer with a scientific background. 

Paul Price spends 10\% of his time on HSC duties, and of the remaining 90\%, 20\% of that time will be spent on science and other activities not related to the PFS. So I estimate that he will be able to spend approximately 16 days per calendar month on the PFS. Neven Caplar spends 20\% of his time on science, so I estimate approximately 18 days per calendar month on the PFS. For Brent Belland, I've estimated that he will spend 10 days per month on his FRD duties. For the remaining developers, the estimates are based on a typical skilled person addressing the corresponding tasks.
